-Change ""Key Sanofi Project Metrics"" to ""NCD Project Key Metrics""
-On the Project tab, the tiles are all different sizes when expanded (I think due to text on 1 line running into 2 lines which lengthens the tile box). They need to be all the same size
-Change text of tile from ""Consumer Reached"" to ""Consumers Reached""
-On Commercial tab, the tiles also need to be the same height and the numbers on the same horizontal, otherwise it looks messy.
-The tile ""Kasha wholesale customers who purchased Sanofi"", this should be a rounded percentage, so 43% not 43.48%.
-There are two tiles with the same metric name ""Kasha wholesale customers who purchased Sanofi"" but different values. Is this a mistake?
- On Product Table tab, can you lengthen the table component so I don't need to scroll down to get to the horizontal bar?
- The charts are all squished on my view, when you maximize the screen. I'll send a photo. You don't need to fit all three on one row

I want to look into all possible factors that could lead to slow loading times and fix especially after order placement, or when a user wants to go back to the previous page. 

Several factors can contribute to slow loading times for mobile applications:
Data Fetching Issues: Inefficient APIs, large payloads, or high latency in fetching data can slow down loading times.
Caching Problems: Lack of effective caching strategies can lead to repeated data fetching, slowing down the app.
Large App Size: Apps that are too large can take longer to load, particularly if they include many images, videos, or other media.
Inefficient Code: Unoptimized code, including heavy use of loops, poor memory management, and inefficient algorithms, can slow down app performance.
Heavy Use of Resources: Applications that consume a lot of CPU, memory, or battery power may perform poorly, especially on older devices.
Background Processes: Other applications running in the background can drain resources and affect the performance of the app being loaded.
Animations and Graphics: Complex animations or high-resolution graphics may take longer to render, affecting loading speed.
Device Limitations: Older devices with limited processing power and memory may struggle to run more complex applications quickly.
Third-Party Libraries: Using heavy or poorly optimized third-party libraries can introduce performance bottlenecks.
Server-Side Delays: If the app relies on server-side processing, delays or downtime on the server can result in slower loading times.
Network Latency: High latency between the device and the server can lead to delays in data transmission.
Poor Network Connectivity: Slow or unstable internet connections can significantly impact loading times, especially for apps that require data from the internet.",HIGH,ENABLER,Permanent Solution for App Load time- improve to less than 5 secs across all pages,4,Pamphile,CW 41,,ACCEPTED,Met some acceptance criteria,,,,,,,,,,,
